# TODO:

- Fix up how DEs are configured, its not modular at all rn, i need to be able to select the DE from hostSpec and it should be able to change config per user
- decouple /pool from places its not needed, or should be optional
  - some users should not have access to pool or just cant access it cuz not local 
- ssh keys are not setup per user
  - should probably fix
